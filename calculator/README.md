# Calculator Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is one of my first react.js projects - it has been abandoned (the logic functions aren't working properly - basic calculations work)
This was my attempt at playing around with:

- react.js hooks
- react.js context API

The CSS is largely written to format this application similar to the iPhone calculator application.
